# Bug Fixes Summary - Workout Generator & Routine Management

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Error: `WorkoutService.createRoutine is not a function`
**Problem**: The frontend was calling `WorkoutService.createRoutine()` but the service exported `createUserRoutine()`.

**Solution**: Added aliases in `workoutService.js`:
- `createRoutine` → `createUserRoutine`
- `updateRoutine` → `updateUserRoutine`  
- `deleteRoutine` → `deleteUserRoutine`

**Files Modified**:
- `main/src/services/workoutService.js` - Added function aliases

---

### 2. ❌ Error: `generateWorkout` returning 500 Internal Server Error
**Problem**: The `generateWorkout` function signature was incorrect - it was expecting `(uid, params)` but should just receive `params` since the uid is obtained from the authentication context.

**Solution**: Updated the function to accept only `params` and removed the uid parameter.

**Files Modified**:
- `main/src/services/workoutService.js` - Fixed function signature

---

### 3. ❌ Error: `updateRoutine` receiving incorrect parameters
**Problem**: RoutineBuilder.vue was calling `updateRoutine(routineId, routineForm)` with two separate parameters, but the function expects a single object containing `routineId` and other fields.

**Solution**: Updated the call to pass a single object with `routineId` spread with the form data.

**Files Modified**:
- `main/src/views/RoutineBuilder.vue` - Fixed updateRoutine call

---

## Testing Results

✅ Static exercises module loading correctly (63 exercises)
✅ Filter function working (24 medium intensity exercises found)
✅ No linting errors

---

## Next Steps

### To Apply These Fixes:

1. **Deploy Firebase Cloud Functions**:
   ```bash
   cd main
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

2. **Restart the Development Server** (if running):
   - Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
   - Restart with `npm run dev`

3. **Test the Fixes**:
   - Go to Workout Generator
   - Try generating a workout with different parameters
   - Go to Routine Builder
   - Try creating/updating/deleting routines

---

## What Was Changed

### `main/src/services/workoutService.js`
- Fixed `generateWorkout()` to accept only `params` instead of `(uid, params)`
- Added convenience aliases: `createRoutine`, `updateRoutine`, `deleteRoutine`
- Exported aliases in both default export and named exports

### `main/src/views/RoutineBuilder.vue`
- Fixed `updateRoutine()` call to pass single object with `routineId` included

---

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Workout Generator**:
   - Should generate workouts successfully
   - Should filter exercises by intensity, muscle groups, and equipment
   - "Save Routine" button should work

2. **Routine Builder**:
   - Should create new routines
   - Should update existing routines
   - Should delete routines
   - Should load exercises from static database

3. **Exercise Library**:
   - Should display all 63 exercises
   - Should filter by muscle group, equipment, intensity, and difficulty
